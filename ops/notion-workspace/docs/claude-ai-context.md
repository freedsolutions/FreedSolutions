# Workspace Context

This workspace is a CRM and operations automation system for **Freed Solutions** (cannabis consulting). The system is managed through a structured session workflow with Claude and documented in the Automation Hub.

**Interfaces:**
- **Claude Code (terminal)** — executes code changes via `/notion` slash command. Reads local `CLAUDE.md` automatically.
- **Claude.ai (chat)** — plans and discusses changes. Reads this page via the `notion-session` skill.

Both interfaces share the same Session — Active page as the handoff mechanism.

**Owner:** Adam Freed

**Record Status** (all 5 source DBs): Draft → Active → Inactive → Delete

**QC formula** (all 5 source DBs): `TRUE` (pass) / `missing:fieldname` (fail) / `wired:PropertyName` (Delete-safe check) / `past_due` (Action Items only)

**Meetings DB Automation** (not an agent): "Page added to Meetings" → sets Record Status = Draft + page icon = 🗓️. Instant, no agent credits.

# Rules of Engagement (Chat Mode)

These rules apply to Claude.ai planning sessions:

1. **Read the Active handoff FIRST** — it has current priorities and system status.
2. **Planning mode by default.** Present the briefing, ask what to tackle, discuss before recommending execution.
3. **Code changes are planned here, executed in Claude Code.** When a plan is finalized, update the Session — Active page with the plan so Claude Code can pick it up.
4. **Only pause for confirmation** when the task is ambiguous, destructive, schema-changing, touches lifecycle state, creates new DB records, or is a migration/bulk operation.
5. **Never create new DB records** unless explicitly instructed.
6. **Never change lifecycle state** (Record Status) without explicit instruction.
7. **Fetch instruction pages on demand** — if discussing a specific agent, fetch its instruction page for full context rather than working from memory.
8. **UI steps require Adam's confirmation before marking complete.** Some tasks can only be done in the Notion UI (configuring agent triggers, pasting large content, Settings changes). When a planning output includes a UI step: (a) explicitly tag it as "Adam — UI step", (b) do NOT mark it complete until Adam confirms, (c) do not assume completion from indirect signals like page existence.
9. **Verify content on sync, not just existence.** When marking a page as "in sync" with a local doc, verify content matches — not just that the page exists.
10. **For Notion workspace doc changes, Codex review happens before session-log updates.** Claude Code should push mapped docs, verify live Notion parity, run the Codex review gate, and only then update the Session — Active log or mark work complete.

**What Claude.ai CAN do directly:**
- Fetch and read any Notion page for review
- Search Notion workspace for context
- Draft instruction page content, agent designs, schema changes
- Update the Session Active page with new priorities
- Light Notion edits (updating text, appending notes) when appropriate

**What should go to Claude Code:**
- Multi-file local doc changes + git commits
- Bulk Notion operations (migrations, sweeps)
- Agent instruction page rewrites (local source-of-truth → push to Notion)
- Schema changes requiring formula updates
